# ProgImage Decision Log

why it's been done like this!

* *No Usership* - In real world apps someone owns the data and there is authentication and authorisation around this. There is nothing in the requirements for this.

* space limiting or clearing old cache isn't covered

* without data discovery (via API) it's easy loose uploaded images. Not covered.
